## ðŸŽ¯ Step 1: Deploy Backend (5 minutes)

### **Option A: Render.com (Recommended)**

1. **Open browser and go to**: https://render.com
2. **Click "Get Started for Free"**
3. **Sign up with GitHub** (use the same GitHub account that has your repo)
4. **Once logged in, click "New +" button** (top right)
5. **Select "Web Service"**
6. **Connect your GitHub repository:**
   - Click "Connect account" if needed
   - Find and select: `ConditionsPortal_RulesEngine`
   - Click "Connect"
7. **Fill in these EXACT settings:**
   ```
   Name: loan-conditions-rules-engine
   Branch: main
   Runtime: Node
   Build Command: npm install && npm run build
   Start Command: npm start
   ```
8. **Scroll down and click "Create Web Service"**
9. **Wait for deployment** (2-3 minutes) - you'll see logs
10. **Copy your service URL** - it will be: `https://loan-conditions-rules-engine.onrender.com`

### **Verify Backend Working:**
- Visit: `https://loan-conditions-rules-engine.onrender.com/health`
- Should see: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

## ðŸŽ¯ Step 2: Check GitHub Pages (Already Working)

Your GitHub Pages should already be working. Check:
1. **Go to your repo**: https://github.com/lesliechangpm/ConditionsPortal_RulesEngine
2. **Settings â†’ Pages**
3. **Verify settings:**
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/docs`
4. **Your site should be live at**: https://lesliechangpm.github.io/ConditionsPortal_RulesEngine/

## ðŸŽ¯ Step 3: Test Everything (2 minutes)

1. **Visit your GitHub Pages site**: https://lesliechangpm.github.io/ConditionsPortal_RulesEngine/
2. **You should see**: Professional interface with demo files
3. **Click "VA Comprehensive Test"** demo button
4. **Should see**: Loan conditions evaluation results
5. **Try uploading your own XML file**

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If Backend URL is different:
If your Render service name ended up different from `loan-conditions-rules-engine`:

1. **Copy your actual Render URL**
2. **Edit this file**: `docs/index.html` (line 330)
3. **Replace**: `'https://loan-conditions-rules-engine.onrender.com'`
4. **With**: `'https://your-actual-url.onrender.com'`
5. **Commit and push the change**

### If GitHub Pages isn't working:
1. **Go to repo Settings â†’ Pages**
2. **Set Source**: "Deploy from a branch"
3. **Set Branch**: `main`, Folder: `/docs`
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment**

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

âœ… **Backend Health**: `https://your-backend-url/health` returns status  
âœ… **Frontend Loads**: GitHub Pages shows professional UI  
âœ… **Demo Works**: Demo buttons load and show results  
âœ… **File Upload**: Can upload XML files and see conditions  

## ðŸ“ž If You Need Help

**Common Issues:**
- **"Repository not found"**: Make sure you're signed into GitHub on Render
- **"Build failed"**: Check Render logs - usually a dependency issue
- **"CORS error"**: Backend URL might be different - update frontend
- **"Demo files don't work"**: Backend might still be starting up (wait 2-3 minutes)

## ðŸŽ¯ Alternative: Railway (If Render doesn't work)

1. **Go to**: https://railway.app
2. **Sign up with GitHub**
3. **"New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Select**: `ConditionsPortal_RulesEngine`
5. **Railway auto-detects Node.js** and deploys
6. **Get your URL** and update frontend if needed
